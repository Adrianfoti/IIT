<p>Assignment 1</p>
  
<h1>A little bit About me</h1>
<p> I am 20 years of age and I'm an ethusiastic, hard working individual. I have a strong Italian background which I take a lot of pride in. I currently have obtained a VCE certificate having completed year 12, a certrifcate II in furniture making, A Worksafe Contruction Induction Card (white Card) and an Onsite Forklift license. A little fact about me is that I was previously an apprentice Cabinet Maker and am now a Building construction worker looking to better my career both physically and finacially. I have an interest in sports such as Soccer, my favourite team being Juventus and in Tennis my favouite player being Rodger Federer. I love to play video games in my free time such as Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Battlefront II and FIFA 20. I also love to muck around with both hardware and software in computers as well as mobile phones to futher my existing passion and knowledge for technology.</p> 
  
<h1>My Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT is extensive and ongoing, I love the fact that almost every aspect of our life has incorperated means of technology, whether that'd be the way we communicate, the way we entertain and the way we can make the lives of others better. My interest in IT began when I was very young. I loved playing around with my old windows XP computer, tweaking it, installing all sorts of interesting software from DVD burners to small flash games. My father has taught me alot about how to take advantage of most basic aspects of a PC, now it seems to be the oppisite and now i tend to teach most of my family how to use their devices. If it wasn't for him, my interest in IT woundn't be anywhere near as passionate as it is today. Also, my love for gaming on the original Xbox when I was a child lit the spark of curiosity of what is happening inside that black box and got me wanting to know what is going on behind what we see on the screen. Open University helped Direct me to RMIT. Hearng a lot from my brother whom also studies at RMIT university, doing a Bachelor of International Buisness, he has informed me that RMIT was the perfect choice for me to start opening my doors to possibility. I have chosen RMIT due to it being an excellent University overall, and the best chance I have moving toward succsess. Throughout the duration of the course, I intend to learn the skill required to be apart of an ICT team in a buisness, vast and plenty of coding lanuguage that I can use to create my projects and also some skills that I can use in my life today.</p>

<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
<p>The job I aspire to achive out of this course would be any sort of position in a team of experts.
  https://www.seek.com.au/job/41185003?type=standard#searchRequestToken=b9ee209c-b6a2-4f88-a96c-704edc3fb286 This position of an IT Manager at Just Digital People is an exeptionally high paying postion. This is an excellent goal to work toward in this field of work. This role excells at creating projects that would be critical for a buisness. They are to ensure the sercurity of all data stored within their database including crucial customer infomation and to eliminate any possible threat to this data.they also direct and manage private timber plantaion companies, magange the estate in the most economical and sustainable way possible as well as balancing needs of customers ensuring they return to do buissness multiple times. To apply for a position such as this, you would need to obtain a bachelors degree in IT, complete an in detailed internship to posses the required skill and experience and a possibility of obtaining a masters degree. At this given time I currently lack skill in most areas of the things required for this role. I do plan on achieving these goals sometime in the future. Sometime during my study years, I intend to do an internship with a small buisness for a fair period of time to extend my knowledge and skills required. I also intend to complete my bachelors to gain the qualification needed for the job.</p>
 
 <h1>My Personal Profile</h1>
 <p> My Myer Briggs test results shows that I am a Mediator. A Mediator is someone who possesses the introverted, intuitive, feeling and prospecting personality traits. This only makes up approximatly 4% of the population and these people are very open minded, caring and creative in their approach. The results of the Online Learning Style test shows that I am a Visual learner. This type of learner best takes on information In a more of a visual style rather than being overly tacticle. Visual learners are neat and tidy and also tend to watch entertainment when bored. In addition, they are also easily distracted and annoyed by noise and other auditory distraction. In my further testing, I did a test on Big Fives Personality Tests at https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2.2,2.2,4.1,2.4,3.3 This shows that the five factors I have are extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and Imagination.
  
Overall, these results are somewhat accurate in the way that they decribe how I best take on information. It is clear to me that the most consistant trait I carry is my ability of imagination. However, thoughout some of these tests, the results have been significantly different such as the Myers test show that I am introveted but the Big Fives test showing that I am infact extroverted. Furthermore I completely agree that I am a visual learner and that I can keep things neat and tidy, I tend to make sense of what I can see rather than being auditory or overlly analytical. These results somewhat mean something to me in the way that most of the tests can see a differnt skill that I have that another test couldn't.

These results could be very useful for the fundimentals of teambuilding. A visual learner can definitely play a significan role in team based projects. A more imaginative person can be crucial in forming ideas and structure to a certain project by creating multiple concepts for the team to use and develop on. This however can be a bit of problem for a visual learner because if there is a more assetive and bossy team member that like to take charge, this can affect put a lot of pressure on the indiviual and effectivly lower the morale or motivaton of said team member. When cosidering this for a team you should take into account that everyone is going to expect something different and trying to apease the entire group can be very difficult. A Educated yet firm approch is needed when putting an idea into the air for all to judge. As well as this the ability to listen, respond and accept a concept that may work out more effectivly than yours is also a good mindset to take into account when teambuilding.</p>

<h1>My Project idea</h1>
<p>For my project idea I would like to develop an interesting smartphone app that can aid people who struggle with losing their important items such as car keys, house keys, wallets, mobile phones and other items of personal interest. This is extremely important to those who have gone out of their house and have misplaced serious items such as a drivers license or a bank card. The project would be to create hardware that has LTE, 4G or a connection to satellite service to have it avaliable to be located with the click of a button at anytime these may be called Seeking Chips. The motivation I have behind this idea would be through past experience of my friends and family losing items when they are at events and functions. This can be devastating as it feels like a loss of privacy, time and money. Also, in 2011, studies reveal the 30 billion US dollars were lost in mobile phones alone, whether that'd be theft, destruction or misplacement. (Study reveals Americans lost $30 billion worth of mobile phones last year | Digital Trends, 2020). This figue may have changed, however, this is still an issue that may need attention toward a solution for those who need it.
Description of the App: This application should most importantly feature a user friendly UI (User Interface) that is clean, has adequate colour profile and is easy to navigate between menus and settings. It should allow the user to sync and unsync the respective seeking chip to the mobile device, and also give the ability to label or rename the chip to what it would be attached to for easy organization. For example, if a Seeking chip is placed on a key ring for a car, it could be labeled as "Car keys" by the user of the device. The user if they wish, could use the mobile device to show a history and accurate timestamp of the items location, allowing the user to retrace their steps. Another handy feature to include would be a feature that weaves in google maps to help give the fastest possable route toward the lost item, meaning it can be set up and ready to go before driving to help avoid extra infringements. The chip can also be used to find more shorter distance items as well, this is done by giving the user the option to play a loud sound that would emit from the seeking chip itself, allowing for extra versatility with domestic misplacement including difficult places like under a couch or in a wardrobe. As for the hardware of the device it would have to be small, slim and discrete, and also made of a sturdy material like steel or an impact resistant plastic like polycarbonate.The hardware would also need the ability to be able to be securely attached to a key ring for bags, backpacks and keys. It would also ba a smart move to include an optional very strong sticking adhesive to attach to the back a mobile device, computer or safely inside of a wallet to ensure that it wont be removed. The sticking adhesive would be optional, and can be removed if unnecessary to the individual. The Hardware would need to include the use a long life rechargeable battery to sustain long periods of time without the need to charge frequently. This would help with the viability of this project as charging devices can be an irritable task which could be a deal breaker for some. This idea does come with a few issues. 1. If a thief is involved, most likely he/she will look for these sort of technologies and simply attempt to destroy it or intentionally misplace it. 2. The battery life could become a problem, if the user has forgotten to charge the item is some period of time, allowing the lost item to be unrecoverable. 3. Connectivity to a service can be a liability if the chip is incompetent in connecting to LTE or 4G. These 3 issues may cause problems for the user however connectivity issues may be fixed with patches and updates to software.
The sofware needed to construct this Application would be an app creation software such as Appey Pie. Appey Pie is a free, easy to use software, that give you the choice of using in depth code or no code at all depending on your skill level. It also gives you the choice of where to publish your product, such as the play store or itunes store. The hardwere would need to be a pre programmed chip along with LTE capibility, a battery with long life, a small powerfull speaker and a slim casing that is sturdy and resistent to shock and damage.
The skill required would be quite extensive and would require professional software writing and language to maximize the efficiency of the Seeker Chips. Sophisticated code for location services both on the app and the chip would need to be properly fabricated, an LTE chip would need to be installed and the apps interface would need to be designed with all buttons and menus working properly. Also the ability to add settings for the user to change the user experience within the application to tweak preferences to make it easier to use. For a student like me it going to be difficult to make this idea feasible anytime soon, due to lack of knowledge and required hardware for this particular project.
If this project is to be successful, it would solve most problems with people who have trouble misplacing their belongings by giving them the means to get on top of that forgetfulness. This app can successfully make sure said person can find their items and also give piece of mind knowing that their belongings going to be safe even if they are lost or stolen. The impact this technology may have is quite positive in the fact that it can make people more aware of how they should store and carry their important items when out of the house, It can also assist if the  item is lost inside the home at any anytime.</p>
