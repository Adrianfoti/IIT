<p>"Assignment 1"</p>
  
<h1>A little bit About me</h1>
<p> I am 20 years of age and I'm an ethusiastic, hard working individual. I have a strong Italian background which I take a lot of pride in. I currently have obtained a VCE certificate having completed year 12, a certrifcate II in furniture making, A Worksafe Contruction Induction Card (white Card) and an Onsite Forklift license. A little fact about me is that I was previously an apprentice Cabinet Maker and am now a Building construction worker looking to better my career both physically and finacially. I have an interest in sports such as Soccer, my favourite team being Juventus and the Tennis. I love to play video games in my free time such as Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and FIFA 20. I also love to muck around with hardware in computers and mobile phones to futher my existing passion and knowledge for technology.</p> 
  
<h1>My Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT is extensive and ongoing, I love the fact that almost every aspect of our life has incorperated means of technology whether that'd be the way we communicate, the way we entertain and make the lives of others better. My interest in IT started when I was very young. i loved playing around with my old windows XP computer, tweaking it, istalling all sorts of interesting software from DVD burners too small flash games. My dad has taught me alot about how to take advantage of most basic aspects on PC, now it seems to be the reverse oppisite and now i tend to teach most of my family how to use my devices. if it wasn't for him, my interest woundn't be anywhere near as passionate as it is today. Also, my love for gaming on the original Xbox when I was a kid lit the spark of curiosity of what is happening inside that black box and got me wanting to know what is going on behind what we see on the screen. Open University helped Direct me to RMIT. Hearng a lot from my brother whom also studies at RMIT university doing a Bachelor of International Buisness, he has informed me that RMIT was the perfect choice for me to start opening my doors to possibility. I have chosen RMIT due to it being an excellent University overall and the best chance I have of moving toward succsess. Throughout the duration of the course, I intend to learn the skill required to be apart of an ICT team in a buisness, vast and plenty of coding lanuguage I can use to create my projects and also some skill i can use in my life today.</p>

<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
<p>The job i aspire to achive out of this course would be any sort of management position in a team of experts.

To apply for a position such as this, you would need to obtain a bachelors degree in IT, complete an in detailed internship to posses the required skill and experience and a possibility of obtaining a maters degree.

Sometime during my studie years I intend to do an internship with a small buisness for a fair period of time. I also intend to complete my bachelors to gain the qualification needed for the job.</p>
 
 <h1>My Personal Profile</h1>
 <p> My Myer Briggs test results shows that I am a Mediator. A Mediator is someone who possesses the introverted, intuitive, feeling and prospecting personality traits. This only makes up approximatly 4% of the population and these people are very open minded, caring and creative thin their approach. The results of the Online Learning Style test shows that I am a Visual learner. This type of learner best takes on information In a more of a visual style rather than being overly tacticle. Visual learners are neat and tidy and also tend to watch entertainment when bored. in addition they are also easily distracted and annoyed by noise and other auditory distraction.in my further testing I did a test on Big Fives Personality Tests at https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2.2,2.2,4.1,2.4,3.3 This shows that the five factors I have are extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and Imagination.
  
Overall, these results are somewhat accurate in the way that they decribe how I best take in information. It is clear to me that the most consistant trait I carry is my ability of imagination. However, thoughout some of these tests the results have been significantly different such as the Myers test show that I am introveted but the Big Fives test show that I am infact extroverted. Furthermore I completely agree that I am a visual learner and that i can keep things neat and tidy, I tend to make sense of what i can see rather than being auditory or overlly analytical. These results somewhat mean something to me in the way that that most of then can see a differnt skill that I have that another test couldn't. These results could be very useful for the fundimentals of teambuilding. A visual learner can definitely play a significan role in team based projects. A more imaginative person can be crucial in forming ideas and structure to a certain project by creating multiple concepts for the team to use and develop on. This however can be a bit of problem for a visual learner because if there is a more assetive and bossy team member that like to take charge this can affect put a lot of pressure on the indiviual and effectivly lower the morale or motivaton of said team member. When cosidering this for a team you should take into account that everyone is going to expect something different and trying to apease the entire group can be difficult. A Educated yet firm approch is needed when putting an idea into the air for all to judge. As well as this the ability to listen, respond and accept a concept that may work out more effectivly than yours is also a good mindset to take into account when teambuilding.
